# Overview

The Java Ranking Service is an implementation of Mark Glickman's glicko-2 algorithm for rating player performance, with extensions for multiplayer and team games. Using these ratings, the ranking service provides leaderboard and match-making functionality.

This library was designed to be used with the Sun Game Server, a multiplayer game server for Java, which was part of the now defunct [Project Darkstar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Darkstar). The ranking service stands on its own, though, and could be adapted for use in other platforms.
