In early 2023, ChatGPT was really getting noticed and there was a lot of hype around machine learning and generative AI.
At that time, the Oooh platform had just pivoted to support a group chat app, and generative AI seemed like an obvious fit.
However, I wanted to get beyond the hype and try to understand how it worked, so I could figure out how best to make
use of it in our platform.

While looking for materials on the subject, I came across the [Machine Learning specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/) offered by DeepLearning.AI, and decided to try that. I highly recommend it for anyone looking
to go deeper into machine learning. So much so, in fact, that I wanted to pass that knowledge on to my team. 
The video below is my attempt to condense that 1 month course down into an hour or so. Production values are low, but I thought I'd
share it out in case anybody else is looking for a crash course on the inner workings of machine learning,
